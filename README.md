# uSDX-mOnO-PA
Power Amplifier for uSDX Mono

This is a alpha version of 10m power amplifier for uSDX mOnO.
It will take place in the last layer of the uSDX mOnO.

Note that it is currently in testing.
I keep making things better.
Currently 10w @ 28mhz

The simulation folder contains an LTspice equivalent.
