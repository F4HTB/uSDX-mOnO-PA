# uSDX-mOnO-PA
Power Amplifier for uSDX Mono.  

This is a alpha version of 10m power amplifier for uSDX mOnO.  
It will take place in the last layer of the uSDX mOnO.  

Note that it is currently in testing.  
I keep making things better.  
Currently ~10w @ 28mhz with harmonics below 46dbc.  

The simulation folder contains an LTspice equivalent.  

Please read the notes in the diagram.
